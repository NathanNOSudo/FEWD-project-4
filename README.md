# FEWD-project-4

## Passed with Exceeds expectations

Project 4. Showing knowledge of sass. Creating a Sass stylesheet. 

I'll be honest sass is not my favorite 
subject. I'd rather walk on hot coals
then have to start from scratch with sass
Everytime I have to use it.

# Good news

You can use this stylesheet for future 
projects and adjust code to your liking!

Saves a lot of time and repetitive coding on your 
Web developing projects.
